Ingredients
-----------

### Filling
* 95 g light or dark brown sugar
* 50 grams granulated sugar
* 1 g salt
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnnamon
* 2 g grated nutmeg
* 4 g ground ginger
* 2 whole cloves, ground
* 2 kg baking apples
* 15 g (or until all fluid is bound) guar gum or other binder

### Crust

<!-- based on Smitten Kitchen https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/03/extra-flaky-pie-crust/ -->

* 260 g all-purpose flour
* 15 g granulated sugar
* 2 g salt
* 230 g cold, unsalted butter
* 120 g very cold water
* (optional) 1 egg

Preparation
-----------

### Filling
* Combine sugars, salt, and spices in your absolutely largest bowl. Peel, halve, and core your apples and cut them into thin (scant 1/4-inch) slices, adding them right to the big bowl. Toss to coat the slices as much as possible. Set aside for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature.

### Crust

* Place your flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Cut your butter into small cubes (1/2-inch is ideal here) and add them into the flour mixture. Toss them around so that they’re coated and used your fingers to squash each butter cube into flatter, lima-bean like pieces. It’s totally fine if this is bigger than you’re used to.
* Pour water over butter-flour mixture and use a flexible silicone spatula or scraper to bring it together into a dough that will seem too wet and sticky, but will be just fine. Divide dough into two parts, and wrap each half into flat-ish packets wrapped in plastic, waxed or parchment paper.
* chill in the fridge until firm — one to two hours.
* Unwrap first packet of dough, place on a well-floured counter, sprinkle the top generously with flour, and roll it out into a thick-ish long rectangle. Brush off excess flour off dough with your hands and fold it as you would a business letter, into thirds. Continue to roll this packet into the shape needed for your final pie.

### Assembly
* Stir binder into apple pie filling. Pour filling into prepared bottom crust and use your hands to pack and heap those softened apples as mounded as you can get them, then add a few more. Pour any juices that have accumulated carefully over apples; do not leave any behind. Either place your second pie dough round over the filling or cut it into strips to lattice the top.
* Trim the top crust or lattice strips to the edge of the pie dish.
* Fold the overhang from the lower crust over to form a thick rim, and crimp it together with your fingers or a fork to seal it.
* (optional) Brush top crust with egg.
* If your top crust is in one piece, cut a few vents in it with a sharp knife.

### Baking
* Preheat oven to 200°C
* Reuse that sheet of parchment paper on the large baking sheet for easier cleanup, then transfer your prepared pie onto it. Bake for 75 minutes. If your pie is browning too fast, take a large square of foil, mold it over the back of a large bowl into a convex dome, then use that to cover the pie in the oven for the remaining baking time so it doesn’t brown much further. Pie is done when the internal temperature reads 90°C. A tester inserted into the pie shouldn’t hit any overtly crunchy apple pieces.

### Serving
Cool pie for at least one hour at room temperature before cutting into it. However, your filling will not fully thicken until it has fully cooled, ideally in the fridge for a couple hours. You can rewarm slices as you serve them, if desired. Leftovers keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, and in the fridge for 1 week.
