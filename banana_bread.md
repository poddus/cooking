Banana Bread
============

This recipe is flexible.
* Flour can be partially subsituted with nut flour (almond, hazelnut, etc.) for a richer texture. I recommend replacing 100 g of the flour.
* Butter can be subsituted with coconut oil, or nut butter.

Ingredients
-----------

* 250 g all-purpose flour
* 5 g baking soda (1/2 packet)
* 2 g salt
* 100 g butter
* 100 g brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 500 g mashed overripe bananas (approx. 4-6 bananas)
* optional
    * vanilla
    * tonka bean
    * cinammon
    * walnuts
    * raisins
    * etc.

Preparation
-----------

* Preheat oven to 180 Â°C
* Lightly grease a loaf pan (23 x 13 cm)
* Combine wet and dry ingredients separately
* Add dry to wet, stir to combine
* pour batter into loaf pan

Bake for about 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
