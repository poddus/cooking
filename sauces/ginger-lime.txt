Ingredients:
2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons fish sauce
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce, dried red chili flakes, or chopped fresh hot chilies

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients in a blender or mini food processor, and blend until you have a fairly smooth sauce. Transfer to a small bowl, stir to be sure the sugar has dissolved, and set aside until serving time. Or combine the ginger, garlic, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a mortar and grind to a grainy paste. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the fish sauce, lime juice, water, and chili-garlic sauce, stirring until the sugar is dissolved and the sauce is fairly smooth. Pour the sauce into small serving bowls. Or transfer to a jar, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Makes about 1/2 cup
