* Yields approx. 20 buns
* 7 hours to 10 hours total
* 1 hour 30 minutes active

Ingredients
-----------
* Dough
	* 200 ml water
	* 300 ml cold whole milk
	* 10 g ground cardamom seed
	* 125 g sugar
	* 7 g salt
	* 2 g fresh yeast
	* 20-30 g ripe sourdough starter
	* 800-875 g all-purpose flour (11% protein)
	* 150 g unsalted butter
* Filling
	* 150 g unsalted butter
	* 150 g sugar
	* 15 g ground cardamom or ground cinnamon
 
Preparation
-----------
* Dough
	* Combine water and milk in a bowl.
	* Add ground cardamom, sugar, and salt. Mix to combine.
	* Add fresh yeast and sourdough starter. Mix to combine.
	* Add flour (go for some wholemeal for added flavor, but stick to mainly roller milled or stoneground wheat). Mix it together by hand or machine until all flour is absorbed.
	* Rest covered for 15-30 minutes.
	* Now it’s time to add butter. Using a cheese slicer, add half at first and knead it in until incorporated. Then add the rest using the same method. This can be hard workout, but totally worth it in the end, making the buns even juicier and softer.
	* Rest an hour covered. Pour the dough on the bench and fold it over itself, into a package. Use tension pulls to make a big tight ball, then transfer into a clean bowl.
	* The goal is to have a very relaxed dough at shaping, so let it rest for 3-4 hours in room temperature now, untouched.
* Filling
	* Prepare the filling during the wait: Mix butter, sugar, and ground cardamom or cinnamon until smooth. Let it stay in room temp until it’s time to shape.
* Shape & Proof
	* Pour dough onto a lightly floured surface. Stretch it to a rough square, then roll it out with a rolling pin into a larger rectangle (30x40cm).
	* Spread the filling over the rectangle using a large spatula or soft dough scraper.
	* Fold the sides in towards the middle, making them overlap at the center. Three layers of dough and two layers of filling. Roll out once more to a larger rectangle.
	* Cut stripes of 75-80g dough (about 2cm wide). Roll them into a knot and place on an oven tray with space in between for proofing.
	* Cover with plastic or a wet linen cloth and let it proof until about double size.
* Bake 
	* Egg wash the buns before baking and sprinkle with ground cardamom and granulated sugar.
	* Bake at 464°F until golden brown (10-12 min).
