1. Knead for 3 minutes. Work in the soft butter. Keep kneading for 4 minutes. Desired dough temperature 25 – 27 C. If your dough is warmer, then it will ferment more rapidly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing time accordingly.
1. Cover and ferment for 1 hour.

Roll each dough piece in the sugar mix. Layer the dough pieces in aca. 1 kg loaf tin with the butterscotch sauce in between. Keep a little bit of sauce for brushing after the bake.
1. Final proof 1.5 hours. During the final hour of fermentation preheat the oven to 160C, FAN ON.
1. Bake the loaf for 50 minutes or until the internal temperature reads above 94C.
1. Brush the top (which will later be the bottom) of the loaf with the butterscotch sauce. Let it set for 10 minutes.
