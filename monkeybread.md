Method

1. Make the butterscotch sauce by adding all the ingredients to a pot and bringing it up to the boil on medium to high heat. Boil for 1 minute. Set aside to cool down to room temperature.
1. In a bowl combine the milk, yeast, salt, sugar, and egg. Mix well to dissolve the sugar & hydrate the yeast. Add the flour and mix to a dough.
1. Knead for 3 minutes. Work in the soft butter. Keep kneading for 4 minutes. Desired dough temperature 25 – 26C (77-79F). If your dough is warmer, then it will ferment more rapidly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing time accordingly.
1. Cover and ferment for 1 hour.
1. Fold.
1. Ferment for 1 more hour.
1. Flatten the dough and cut it into 2 – 3cm pieces (around 1 inch). They do not have to be perfect, just do not make them too large. Dip each piece of dough in the melted butter. Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and clove. Roll each dough piece in the sugar mix. Layer the dough pieces in a loaf tin with the butterscotch sauce in between. I am using a 1kg (2lb) loaf tin. Keep a little bit of sauce for brushing after the bake.
1. Final proof 1.5 hours. During the final hour of fermentation preheat the oven to 160C (320F) FAN ON.
1. Bake the loaf for 50 minutes or until the internal temperature reads above 94C (200F).
1. Brush the bottom the loaf with the butterscotch sauce. Let it set for 10 minutes.
1. Tip the loaf out on a board or plate. Brush all over with the remaining sauce.
1. Enjoy whilst warm!
