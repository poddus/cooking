Chocolate Chip Cookies
======================

based loosely on the tollhouse cookie recipe, but better (of course), with mostly mass units, and adjusted for german standard grocery units. makes about 10-15 large cookies, depending on hwo disciplined you are with the cookie dough.

Ingredients
-----------
* 200 g cultured (sauerrahm) butter
* 350 g flour (type 405)
* 350 g white sugar
* 20 g molasses (optionally white and brown sugar half and half)
* 15 g baking powder
* 2 eggs
* 5 g coarse salt
* 200 g chocolate chunks (block chocolate)
* 40 ml rum, gold or dark
* 2 g ground vanilla bean

Preparation
-----------
* preheat oven to 190 °C
* brown the butter golden
	* melt butter on low heat, then turn high and stir continuously while the water boils off
	* the bubbles will be large at first, once the bubbles get small and a thick froth starts to build, turn off the heat, still stirring, until the desired color is reached
	* set aside to cool
* combine flour, sugar, molasses, baking powder, and eggs in a bowl
* add rum to butter to make an emulsion, replacing the water that was boiled off previously (careful, the butter has to be cooled off sufficiently, otherwise it can explode... ask me how i know)
* add vanilla bean to butter
* add wet to dry, add chocolate, and stir to combine
* set dough aside for 15-30 minutes to hydrate
* scoop dough onto baking sheet (approx. ice cream scoop size)
* bake on the middle rack for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown on the edges
