Shrimp Palermo
(Southern Living)

Makes 4 Servings

5 plum tomatoes
1 (12 oz) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and chopped 
½ cup Italian vinaigrette dressing
1 ¼ unpeeled, large fresh shrimp
½ cup all-purpose baking mix
1 Tbsp salt-free Cajun seasoning
3 Tbsp butter, divided
2 cups (8 oz) shredded provolone cheese


COMBINE first 3 ingredients; spoon evenly into 4 (1 ½ cup) lightly greased individual baking dishes. (Or you can use one shallow oven proof pan, lightly greased.)  Set aside

PEEL shrimp and devein if desired.  (I used two one-pound bags of thawed frozen shrimp, medium)

COMBINE baking mix and Cajun seasoning.  Dredge shrimp in mixture.  (I used pancake and waffle mix with Badia Complete seasoning.)

MELT 1 ½ Tbsp butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; add half of shrimp and cook, stirring constantly, 3 to 5 minutes or just until shrimp turns pink.  Repeat with remaining 1 ½ tbsp butter and shrimp.  (I used a large skillet and worked with 3 batches.)

SPOON  shrimp evenly over tomato mixture.  Sprinkle evenly with cheese.

BROIL 5 inches from heat 3 minutes or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.  Garnish with parsley if desired.

NOTE:  This dish was very easy to prepare while talking to guests and got rave reviews.  I think it would have been just as good without the red peppers that were fairly expensive.  People were happy with the just the shrimp, tomato, cheese combo.
