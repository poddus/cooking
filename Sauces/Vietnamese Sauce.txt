Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce or finely chopped fresh hot red chilies (or 1 teaspoon dried red chili flakes)
3 tablespoons fish sauce
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice

Directions:
Combine the garlic, sugar, and chili-garlic sauce, chilies, or flakes in the bowl of a mortar and mash to a paste. (Or combine them on your cutting board and mash to a coarse paste using a fork and the back of a spoon.)
Scrape the paste into a small bowl and stir in the fish sauce, water, and lime juice. Stir well to dissolve sugar.
Transfer to small serving bowls for dipping. Or transfer to a jar, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

Yields about 1/2 cup
